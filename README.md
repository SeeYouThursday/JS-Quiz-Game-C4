# JS-Quiz-Game-C4

## Description

The user is presented with instructions to utilize this site. Users will have 60 seconds to answer four multiple choice questions regarding Javascript. Each question will appear only after an answer has been selecting beginning with the first question. Through this challenge, I have learned how utilize the API to create timers, manipulate the DOM, and leverage eventlisteners in production.

To utilize this Javascript Review Quiz, simply click "start" after reviewing the instructions to begin taking the four question multiple choice quiz. Wrong answers will subtract 10 seconds from the timer, while correct answers will award the user 10 points each. At the end of the game (either timer = 0 or no questions remain), the user is given a chance to store their high score using the localStorage. The user will then be presented with their current high score and previous attempt rendered as a list. Using the "Play Again" button (displayed only at the high score screen), the user can choose to retake the quiz.
